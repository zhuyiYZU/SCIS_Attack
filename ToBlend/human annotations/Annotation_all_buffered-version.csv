Each team only plays four pre-season games, but there is a long-term schedule for each team in the preseason and postseason. Each team starts the preseason in the same week it goes onto the field for the regular season. For instance, the Philadelphia Eagles begin the first preseason game on Thursday, April 13, and finish the fourth preseason game on Sunday, April 20.

The game 's pace is not the same between home and away. The goal ies are different. Even the field level dimensions at the stadium are kept strictly separate for home and away games. In essence, the NFL pre-season is like two different games, at once. Because of this, the NFL is probably the most uniform of all the major American sports leagues.

The ""pigskin"" campaign comes as Muslims are being increasingly targeted by hardline Muslim separatists and Islamist extremists in Xinjiang, home to Muslim Uighurs. The campaign appears to have been led by Urumqi police.

The police crackdown on Islamic attire comes just days after Xinjiang officials announced the banning of headscarves in school-related activities.

The China Islamic Lawyer's Association, a private group, said the ban was ""cruel persecution against the Uighurs"".
