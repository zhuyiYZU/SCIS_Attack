The occasion also contained an international conference on Slavic literature in France. During the conference there were many discussions on the ways in which the Serbian and Croatian literary traditions could serve as a bridge for the European literary project. The most significant among them was the conference held on 14-15th January 1959, in Paris between Srdja Trifunovic, the literary critic and leader of the Slovene Renaissance, and Jadranka Lajeva (later president-designate of the Council of Europe).

The Slovene Renaissance was a political movement and it took an active part in the formation of a new Slovenia. It was strongly in favour of the ""cultural autonomy"" of Slovenia, its independence from central authority.","In 1954 , major Serbian and Croatian writers , linguists and literary critics , backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement , which in its principles rejected nationalism and the use of any terminology that suggested the existence of states, independent national ities or republic s within the union of the states.

Among the stated reasons Bush used for this was that Saddam's weapons capabilities were a threat to the US. Bush, however, had ignored US intelligence which showed that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction at the time.

In March 2003, Congress passed and Bush signed off on the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF, also known as the Iraq Liberation Act. This act authorized the president to use the US military in ""any manner and for any purpose"" in order to combat ""the Iraq threat.""

The President said, ""The time is long overdue to free the Iraqi people from dictatorship and tyranny."" Bush even went off on a tangent about Saddam's supposed ""war crime"" in the 1990s as well as what he perceived as a lack of the Syrian government's response to a Sarin gas attack.

Among the stated reasons for removing Saddam was to prevent him from obtaining or selling nuclear weapons. The Bush administration was worried that Saddam might give a nuclear weapon to terrorists, either in exchange for weapons of mass destruction, or in defiance of U. N. Security Council mandates on the issue. And it was worried Saddam might use the weapons to retaliate for international attacks.

Usually they are red cards . Ref erees may make some decisions on the field and that is the only time that he uses a judgement . The ref e rees are allowed full control of the match . It is just a question of which referee has more time ( as the referee is playing with two hands ) . If a player/ team gets more red cards then they will be disqualified . Usually , the team with more red cardes takes a penalty shoot out with the other team . The team that loses the penalty shoot out or loses the match becomes disqualified . It is always the best interest of the one playing that wins that a penalty shoot out should be used . It is because this is the only possible way to truly eliminate the potential in play foul (","In practice , not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match . Usually the referee not only has better judgement in this instance however , they also have a better understanding of how to control the match ( more on this later ) . In other words , they have the best of all possible worlds : they know the rules but are not obligated to follow them . This is the biggest problem when people talk about bad referee decisions . There are two reasons for the referee not to stop the match : 1 . They already know they will not . They have no interest in enforcing the rules and they usually have the final word . This is why they have such a big role in the match . Without this power they would have to stop all sorts of matches and the match referee is the one who decides when to stop a match","In practice , not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match .

Should a player decide to appeal , the appeal must be made to one of the referees , the TO or the official scorers , .

Usually , the referee will use his judgment for a very limited time before handing down a penalty . One reason , in many cases , to disqualify a player or player pair could be if they fail a pre match medical examination for injury . This is when either one player or one player pair will be disqualified . If they have failed an in-person medical examination for an injury then they are not allowed to participate in the next match . Another rule violation could be if a player or player pair deliberately throws their match . This occurs when the referee feels that the actions of the offender are deliberate enough to warrant a foul. If the referee uses judgement in the way they do , then they do not automatically disqualify or flag any players or player pairs at will . The reason many players in the WTA or the ATP have a short contract is that with a short contract , you are allowed to be flexible enough and sometimes give yourself some games .",4.666666667,5.666666667,5,4.333333333,5.666666667,6,2.666666667,5,4.333333333,5,5.333333333,5.333333333,4.333333333,4.666666667,4.333333333,5.666666667

The ""pigskin"" campaign comes as Muslims are being increasingly targeted by hardline Muslim separatists and Islamist extremists in Xinjiang, home to Muslim Uighurs. The campaign appears to have been led by Urumqi police.

The police crackdown on Islamic attire comes just days after Xinjiang officials announced the banning of headscarves in school-related activities.

The China Islamic Lawyer's Association, a private group, said the ban was ""cruel persecution against the Uighurs"".
